      <div class="fundraising-wrap">
        <p class="paragraph white">We are committed to protecting the privacy of children who use https://www.volunteerbuild.com and its services. We encourage parents to engage with us in protecting their children’s privacy, ensuring a safe and enjoyable online experience.<br><br>This children’s privacy policy is part of our approach to privacy, and covers the way we collect, store and manage information provided by children under the age of 13, in accordance with the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).<br><br>‍<strong>Collecting information from children</strong>: At times, we may require information from children to enable participation in certain activities, for example, registering an account, customising a profile, or receiving notifications. When collecting non-personal information, we encourage children never to provide any details that may personally identify them or reveal their location. We do not require children to provide more information than is necessary to participate in an activity. We do not use children’s contact details for marketing purposes, though we may use them for our internal marketing and research in order to improve the quality of products and services offered across our site.<br><br>‍<strong>Parental consent</strong>: In accordance with COPPA, if an activity does require any personal information (such as first name, last name, or email address), we will provide notice to and seek consent from a parent or guardian prior to collecting the information. We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to enable participation in the requested activity. In the event we discover we have collected personal information in a manner non-compliant with COPPA, we will either delete the information or seek parental consent. As a parent/guardian, if you believe your child is participating in an activity that collects personal information, and you have not received a notification or request for consent, please feel free to get in touch via our contact page https://www.volunteerbuild.com. We do not use parent contact details for marketing purposes unless marketing materials are explicitly requested.<br><br>‍<strong>Safeguarding children’s privacy</strong>: We take security seriously, and do what we can within commercially acceptable means to protect your child’s personal information from loss or theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. That said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and cannot guarantee absolute data security.<br><br>‍<strong>Information abuse and community misconduct</strong>: We do not tolerate doxing (publishing of private or personal information about an individual without their consent), cyberbullying, or other forms of information abuse on <span class="text-link">https://www.volunteerbuild.com</span>. If we discover that a child’s personal information has been disclosed on our site without the express consent of their parent/guardian, we will remove the content in question as quickly as possible and effect disciplinary measures (a warning, suspension or ban) on the offending account.<br><br>‍<strong>Third-party access to information</strong>: We do not knowingly disclose any personally identifying information or personal information provided by children to third parties. We may, however, disclose anonymised and aggregated versions of this information (analytics and statistics) for business, marketing or public relations purposes.<br><br><strong>Parental controls and intervention</strong>: As a parent/guardian, you may at any time refuse to let us collect further information from your children for a particular activity or account. If you have given us consent previously, you may log in to your child’s account to review, edit or delete the information, or contact us via to request the removal of the information from our records.<br><br><em>Please be aware that the removal of certain information may result in the termination of the associated account, or withdrawal from the associated activity.</em></p>
