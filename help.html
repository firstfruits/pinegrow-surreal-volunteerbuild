      <div class="faq-volunteerbuild w-richtext">
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <p>If you need assistance with funding your contribution to house costs or the cost of your personal trip, try some of the following fund raising ideas (we have included what people have told us they have raised per event FYI)</p>
        <p><strong>Do you just build homes?</strong></p>
        <p>As well as building homes we also undertake the following activities while we are in Mexico:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li><strong>Volunteer at the local orphanage</strong>. The orphanage that we are currently working with is very poor and has limited supplies. We purchase food, bring much needed bedding and educational supplies, as well as host a Children&#x27;s Party at the orphanage. This is a vital part of our visit. Our teams play outdoor games (they love soccer!), indoor games, make puppets and then have a puppet show, do hair braiding, necklace making, face painting, colouring and painting as well as having stories and enjoying singing children&#x27;s songs with the kids</li>
          <li><strong>Volunteer</strong> at a local women&#x27;s refuge. Activities here vary depending on what the need is. Sometimes we bring in food, other times talk and encourage the women, while other times it can be maintenance and building repairs</li>
          <li><strong>Visit the local school</strong> - We have excellent relationships with some of the local schools where we have been involved with building in the past.  We deliver educational supplies for students who can’t afford them as well as spending time talking with the principal and staff about local issues affecting them and the children.  We are also involved in the classroom from time to time teaching health and hygiene and interacting with the local students.  Often if we have school age young people in our group it is a wonderful cross cultural exchange as the students ask questions and learns about the others culture and life</li>
          <li><strong>Visit a local drug and alcohol detox centre</strong> - Drugs and alcohol have a devastating effect on the lives of people living in the slums.  At the drug and alcohol detox centre we talk to the recovering addicts and encourage them in their journey.  Sometimes we will host a graduation fiesta for them inside the facility when they have completed a significant milestone or course</li>
          <li><strong>Host a street fiesta</strong> - for the locals to celebrate the completion of the houses.  We bring in a mobile taco stand, cater for approximately 200 people, get the word out and wait and see who turns up!   We have games for the kids and a street fiesta is not complete without the pinata smash and a water balloon fight in the street!  Any left over food (often there is not a lot) is distributed to local families in need.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How safe are we in Mexico?</h3>
        <p>From time to time you will hear about some incident or other that has occurred in Mexico.  Break Free Expeditions takes trip safety seriously and has a number of measures to ensure safety of the teams while in Mexico. These include:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>Registering our group prior to departure with the NZ Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade</li>
          <li>Comprehensive travel insurance is compulsory for all Break Free Expeditions attendees</li>
          <li>We stay in secure accommodation complexes which have 24/7 security.  Security guards request ID before entrance is granted</li>
          <li>We stay approximately 45 mins from the building site and always leave the site while it is light. Our daily routine varies and we use basic passenger vans for travelling</li>
          <li>It is a trip requirement that anyone under the age of 18 travels with a Trip Guardian</li>
          <li>Our local partners and suppliers (accommodation, catering etc) on the ground in Mexico are well known by Break Free Expeditions.  The local authorities (including police) know our partner organisation well and they are well respected by the community we build in</li>
          <li>Our experienced trip guides know the area and the project well and ensure that all volunteers are well briefed on keeping safe while in Mexico.  We also use radio phones to keep in contact with one another</li>
          <li>We also expect our trip attendees to exercise caution and common sense, and to stay away from and not participate in any illegal activities (eg under age drinking, drugs etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The NZ Ministry of Foreign Affairs regularly issues Travel Advisories which can be found at <a href="https://www.safetravel.govt.nz/">www.safetravel.govt.nz</a>
        </p>
        <p>Contact details for the New Zealand Embassy – Mexico City, Mexico are:<br>Street Address:   Jaime Balmes No 8, 4th Floor, Los Morales, Polanco, Mexico D.F. 11510<br>Telephone:   +52 55 5283 9460 Facsimile +52 55 5283 9480<br>Email: <a href="mailto:kiwimexico@prodigy.net.mx">kiwimexico@prodigy.net.mx</a><br>Office hours:   Mon – Thu 0830 – 1400, 1500 – 1730 hrs; Fri 0830 – 1400 hr</p>
        <h3>How are the families selected that receive homes?</h3>
        <p>The families that we build homes for are selected by BCM, our partner on the ground working in the slums in Mexico.  Families can make an application to BCM, and if their application is approved, they are put on a prioritised waiting list by need.  In order to apply to BCM the families need to:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>Have a recent letter from the land office showing that family household members have no other property</li>
          <li>Provide a copy of the deed to the land, or present a voucher showing at least last six months payments for the land (note land cost is between US$1,000 and US$5,000 per lot)</li>
          <li>Provide copies of birth certificates for each member of the family</li>
          <li>Provide paycheck stubs or payment receipts for each member of the family who is working</li>
          <li>Provide a photograph of the family</li>
          <li>Have a minimum of 3 children (although special cases are considered)</li>
          <li>Provide a sketch map showing the exact location of the land including street, block and lot number, along with the name of the colony</li>
          <li>A letter explaining the family’s need and why they would like a home to be built for them</li>
          <li>Full contact details</li>
        </ul>
        <p>BCM assesses the applications and obtains references to ensure that the applications are valid.  As BCM are working every week in the colony, they have a good idea of the need and who the residents are.</p>
        <h3>How do I register for a trip?</h3>
        <p>Your trip fees do not include:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>Travel insurance (although we do negotiate a favourable group rate for teams departing from New Zealand – refer Trips – Travel Insurance for more information)</li>
          <li>Personal spending money</li>
          <li>Some trip meals (refer Trip Program for more details)</li>
          <li>Any vaccinations or medical examinations that are required</li>
          <li>Any extra items that you would like to purchase to give away while in Mexico (eg stuffed toys, children’s books, sunglasses, extra gifts for the family, candy, tools for building, educational supplies, clothing, linen etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why do you build homes in Mexico?</h3>
        <p>Mexico has a population of approximately 107 million people, with approximately 60 million living below the poverty line on less than US$2.50 per day.  24 million people live in extreme poverty in a society where there is no safety net.  Break Free Expeditions was first introduced to the Mexico House building project by Global Tribe, the Christian band “newsboys” aid organisation, and has established relationships with this project.</p>
        <h3>Where do my trip fees go?</h3>
        <p>We aim to keep our fees to a minimum in order to make our opportunities accessible.  Here is a general overview of where your trip fees go in preparing for your volunteer opportunity, while volunteering and after you return home.</p>
        <ul role="list">

        <h2> </h2>
        <h2>Find out what Art Green, TV reality star &amp; host, thought of his 2018 Mexico Volunteer Build</h2>
        <p>In 2018 I decided to sign up for a trip with Volunteer Build to build a house for a family in Tijuana, Mexico.</p>
        <p>I signed up because I wanted to have an adventure and to make a meaningful change to the lives of some people less fortunate than myself.</p>
        <p>Upon landing in LA, I joined 10 other strangers who were in the same boat as me – no-one had any experience but we were all keen to get stuck in. We piled into a minivan and headed south to the Mexican border.</p>
        <p>Over the course of three days we built a house for a family of seven, who before then were living in a one room make-shift shack made of bits of wood and plastic and anything else they could find. The dad worked fulltime as a plasterer and brick-layer and only earned $100/week to support everyone.</p>
        <p>I had had zero experience building prior to this trip, so it was all very new to me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. All materials were pre-cut so it was like we were just hammering all the pieces in place, lining the walls, plastering, sanding and painting. I was amazed at how quickly we were able to build the whole house.</p>
        <p>Seeing the smiles and tears of joy on the family members’ faces when we handed over the keys was a truly humbling moment. I think the magnitude of what we had done for them really hit home when I watched the mum’s face as she walked into her new home for the first time.</p>
        <p>It really put things into perspective for me and really made me appreciate how good we have it in New Zealand. It also reminded me that happiness is not found in money and things, but in health and family.</p>
        <p>The other members of my group are now good friends. I couldn’t recommend this experience more highly! A huge thanks to Diana and the incredible work she does with Volunteer Build.</p>
